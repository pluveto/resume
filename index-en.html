                        Hi, I'm Zijing, Zhang from the School of Computer Science of Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications. I've been dived into coding research and creation for years. I found that the world of programming brings us power to design rule freely thus ingenious systems are constructed. And in this world, I noticed that my curiosity and ablitiy to learn quickly are my main merits.

                    <ul>
                        <li>During my internship, I had the following major achievements.
                            <ol>
                                <li>
                                    <b>Built Azure Pipeline based DevOps workflows.</b> Including CI/CD for Airflow DAG, Gateway microservices, Spark Jobs.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <b>Testing, optimizing and eventually refactoring our Gateway microservices.</b>
                                     As one of our Big Data infrastructures, Gateway is our Telemetrics submission portal.
                                     The legacy Gateway was developed based on Javascript and was completely down in the face of a Live Site event.
                                     Requests reached 1.2B/day, about six times the usual volume.
                                     We saved it by making three optimizations:
                                     first, a comprehensive optimization of stability,
                                     and second, an optimization of the batching mechanism.
                                     The third was the debottlenecking of the Azure Eventhub infrastructure.
                                     The first two were done by me. The final system's stability and concurrency performance were greatly improved.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <b>Locating and solving memory leaks in online Kibana clusters</b> Through heapdump tool and source code analysis,
                                    we found that the cause of memory leak is that the logs in verbose mode are not released in memory.
                                    This was solved by tuning the configuration.

                    <p class="line"><b>Summary</b> I have grown tremendously during my internship at Microsoft.
                        First, I was exposed to a lot of online code and experienced a Live Site, and realized that
                        it is extremely difficult and complex to develop reliable software that lasts, from development,
                        testing, AB-Test to go-live, monitoring, and O&M, each step requires a lot of people's efforts
                        and requires us to withstand some pressure outside of technology. At the same time, I was exposed
                        to and involved in building a standardized code management process.
                        I also got a first glimpse of the architecture of some large software projects,
                        such as Data Pipeline, and my ability to read the source code of large programs.
                        
                        Secondly, I realized that in addition to technical skills, communication, cooperation
                        and leadership skills are also important for general development.
                        
                        Finally, I realized that I should not only use the existing technical framework,
                        but also know how to implement it, so that I will not be overwhelmed when
                        I encounter problems. A deep understanding of the business, a search for the
                        underlying technical principles, and the ability to communicate, cooperate
                        and take responsibility can make an excellent engineer.

                            <li>Linear development scenarios: for example, lead the development of core semantic analysis and code generation in compiler course design. Also assigned tasks according to group members' abilities, met weekly to determine progress, and achieved a score of 96.</li>
                            <li>Front/back-end separated scenarios: for example, during the development of the campus tour system, I designed the interface in advance and used virtual data to develop it first, and the interface was very smooth. I used Git to collaborate and got a score of 96.</li>
                            <li>Urgent tasks scenarios: for example, in the CPU design and reinforcement learning DDQN tasks in the primary period, the time was tight and the tasks could not be completed offline when there was an epidemic. All of them achieved about 90.</li>

                            I believe that in order to motivate the team members, the most important thing is to clarify what can be brought to our teammates,
                            instead of only assigning tasks. With a high motivation, as long as the work is divided and the time is set, 
                            everyone will be able to make it brilliantly and take the initiative to find things to do.
                            Even without so, regular reporting (such as daily scrums) can also ensure that the project is completed on time.

                        <p class="line">In school, I made friends with a lot of very thoughtful peers and did a lot of valuable things together.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>In my sophomore year, I, together with Liu and some other students
                                 created Shaanxi Youxueyoujiao Technology Co., Ltd. The business is mainly to provide information platforms
                                 such as treeholes for various schools, thus getting information channels and being able to take some promotion orders.。</li>
                            <li>My freshman year was still relatively poor, but after learning the front end, combined with the physics competition experience,
                                I took some front-end physics simulation orders from Beijing Force Superconductor under my sophomore year and earned tens of thousands of dollars.
                                Replaced productivity equipment and became more convinced that my skills were valuable.
                            </li>
                            <li>In my junior year, I founded Incolore Software Studio to facilitate contract business, and used to took a contract of 170,000 CNY,
                                but then I felt that CURDs had been not valuable for my technical improvement, so I developed a code generation system.
                                It also made me realize that I can't stop at the low end of the business and must conduct more in-depth research.
                                Since then, I have not taken up this kind of onerous work.</li>
                            <li>This year, our company was renamed to Beijing WanzhongJuquan Technology Co, Ltd. At present, the monthly flow of cash has reached tens of thousands of yuan.
                                However, since I am the busiest this semester, it is mainly taken care of by Liu.
                                </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p class="text-sm">*Note: I just started to study computer in my freshman year, so I didn't do much.</p>

                            I formed a band in high school and freshman year as an electric guitarist and bassist.
                            In addition, I am interested in philosophy, and have studied the history of Western philosophy, Kantian philosophy, etc.
                            I am interested in history, especially the history of China of the Spring and Autumn Period.
                            In high school, I participated in the physics competition and won the second prize in my province.
                            I also studied some psychology on my own. In my sophomore year, I once fell into anxiety and pain, but soon after I learned about Adler's theory,
                            I quickly self-regulated and strengthened myself and become empowered.
